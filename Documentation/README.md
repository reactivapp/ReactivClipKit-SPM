## Getting Started

ReactivClipKit makes it easy to create rich, dynamic App Clip experiences. Follow these steps to integrate the framework:

1. **Install ReactivClipKit**: Add the package using Swift Package Manager
2. **Initialize ReactivClipKit**: Call `try ReactivClipInitialize(...)` in your SwiftUI App's `init` method
3. **Display**: Use `ReactivClipView()` as your root view
4. **Set Up Event Handlers**: Implement analytics integration using the event system

## Required Dependencies

### Sentry
ReactivClipKit integrates with Sentry for error reporting:
- Add the Sentry package to your App Clip target
- Pass `SentrySDK.self` during initialization to enable error reporting
- No manual Sentry configuration required

## Integration Details

ReactivClipKit integrates with:

- Sentry (required) - for error reporting
- App Store Connect - for app distribution

### Best Practices

- Initialize ReactivClipKit in the SwiftUI App's `init` method, not in AppDelegate
- Use proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Ensure Sentry package is added to your App Clip target
- Always check initialization status with `ReactivClipIsInitialized()`
- Set up event handlers after initialization is complete

## Event System

ReactivClipKit provides a comprehensive event system that allows you to:

- Capture user interactions with typed data models
- Subscribe to specific event types or all events
- Integrate with your analytics platform
- Access detailed information about products, carts, checkouts, and more

The event system uses:
- Type-safe data models for each event type
- Publisher-subscriber pattern for event handling
- Convenience properties for easy data access

For details and examples, see the [Usage Guide](./Usage.md#working-with-events) and the [API Reference](./API.md#event-handling).
